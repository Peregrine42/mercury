to run mercury on your local machine, run:
vagrant up

then point your browser to:
192.168.33.10

you should see a list of transactions that happened
between the logging server and the test rPi instance.

the test rPi instance is at:
192.168.33.15

all traffic is encrypted using HTTPS.

only transactions with requestors showing
a whitelisted UUID are shown.

the datapath should be:
.  rPi request -> nginx log -> logstash log 
-> elasticsearch record -> kibana table

each rPi periodically GETs a particular URL,
according to its UUID.

https://192.168.33.10/rpi/:id

this GET is logged by nginx.

filebeat monitors the nginx logs and forwards them
to logstash.

logstash processes the logs into a format useful
for kibana, and stores them in elasticsearch.

kibana requests data from elasticsearch for analysis.
